# Loan-Calculator
A simple loan calculator that can be used to calculate monthly payments, total payment and total interest based on the inputs provided by the users.

## User

The user must provide three input values which are the "amount" of the loan, "interest" percent, and the "number of years" to repay the loan back. After getting the values for the inputs, the application will show a loader which gives users a feeling that computation is going on. After 2 secs, it will display the results for the user, and after 7 secs, the results and the input fields will get blank so the user can enter new values.

If the user does not provide any input values or fails to provide any one of it, then an error message will be displayed so that the user can correct its mistake.
